We are propelled by a shared love of the city in its social and ecological diversity. We take issue with those calling Beirut “an ugly city” and mourning its once beautiful face. Our message is directed to all city dwellers; we invite everyone to join us in struggling for her/his right to the city, a city where private capital cannot trump the desires of the urban majorities in enlarging and improving the city’s shared commons.

            <h1>Daliet Beirut<small>social, environmental, legal aspects</small></h1>
          </header>
        </div>
        <p>In Arabic, Dalieh refers to any plant that hangs down, typically used to roof terraces where families, neighbors and friends gather to mark the end of the workday during most of the year. In Beirut, Dalieh refers to a vast terrain that extends across from the city’s emblematic Sakhret el-Rawsheh, and slopes gently towards the sea.</p>

        <p>For decades, Daliet-Beirut or Daliet el-Rawsheh has acted as an open-access shared space for a wide variety of city dwellers. Families and friends found in this large green space a natural destination for end-of week picnics, lovers a quiet and idyllic setting, sea-goers a strategic swimming and fishing destination, and communities a xx landscape for the celebration of communal events. This urban commons has also hosted a vibrant informal economy of boat touring, fishing, popular restaurants, peddlers, photographers, and others who have animated the life of this unique area of the city. The site has also been recognized for its ecological wealth, a unique landscape ensemble extending naturally from/to the monumental breakaway rocks that have granted their name to the city district “Rawsheh” (from “rocher”/ meaning “rock” in French but perhaps also Aramaic ‘rosh’ and ‘ras’ meaning head). It includes a rich diversity of topographical and geological features: coastal cliffs on the landside and rock islands, protruding stone terraces and natural pool enclaves, all valuable habitats for native plants, insects, birds and marine fauna in an uncommon ecological equilibrium that has prompted many scientists and researchers to identify it as a prime area for protection in Lebanon.</p>

        <p>This communal space survives amidst the private take-over of the city’s coast that has turned lush sandy and rocky beaches into enclosed, high-end resorts[u1] . These transformations are primarily facilitated by the history of property formation in the city as well as changes in the zoning and building regulations. Since the mid-1960s, pressure by building developers and the propertied elite have reversed the full provisions against building in this zone and allowed increasingly intensive building coefficients that have reached a whooping 60% in some cases and allowed for the privatization of areas typically used as public spaces. Thus, city dwellers are increasingly confined to the 4m wide sidewalk of Avenue des Français, the main artery that runs along the city’s sea-front, while access and visibility to the sea is obscured by an increasing number of private developments consistently serving the needs of the high-heeled urban dwellers and visitors at the expense of the urban majorities. </p>

        <p>Daliet-Beirut doesn’t escape the threat of development: In xx 2014, a newly installed fence bars public access to the sea-shore, signaling the eminent and radical transformation of this shared open-access space. This follows and enshrines the displacement of most site users and the erasure of the physical infrastructure that once sustained their activities: the fishermen boats are gone, their restaurants dismantled, as is the sounding of the children’s laughter that until recently melted in the crashing waves. Only scattered candy wrappers recall the active life that once used to be while large cement blocks stacked by the seaside forewarn of the looming destruction of sea-life that accompanies this type of developments… Ironically, the Municipality of Beirut that had never overlooked public practices in the site despite decades of intensive uses has recently set-up a security booth that actively monitors and constrains the activities of those who choose to defy the fence and reclaim their access to the sea, a right in fact enshrined in the Lebanese law. But there is more: information leaked to activists indicates that several offices have been commissioned, invariably by private parties, to propose urban and building regulations for the area, conduct impact studies required by the law, and formulate actual recreational and commercial developments. Meanwhile, building and zoning regulations were altered yet another time in April 2014, making it possible to build most of the area. Finally, a dubious process of privatization has concentrated ownership since the mid-1990s into the hand of two private companies, both held by the same high-profile politician. Private land holdings have also encroached over the public maritime domain through dubious processes that are obscured by missing property records. In short, the “growth machine” is unleashed, rendering claims over the public nature of this space urgent.</p>

              <h3>What is the coalition for Dalieh?</h3>
              <p> The “Civil Campaign to Preserve Daliet el-Raouche” is a coalition of individuals and non-governmental organizations who have come together since 13 March 2014 in order to advocate for the preservation and enhancement of the role of Dalieh as an open-access shared space for all city dwellers and visitors. Partners in the coalition share a strong commitment to the preservation of Beirut’s shared spaces, ecological and cultural diversity as the pillars of the city’s livability.</p>

              <p> The Coalition encompasses civilians, parents and children, young and old, who are committed to the protection of Beirut’s shared spaces, particularly its sea-front façade as the asset to maintain the livability of the city. It includes individuals, environmental, cultural and civil groups working through legal and civil means to protect the Dalieh as a shared, free and unrestricted area for the people. </p>

              <p>The campaign began in November 2013 through a petition that was published on social media. This evolved into a campaign under the slogan “Lift Your Warshé Off Our Rawshé” (warshé Arabic for construction site). Throughout this past year, we’ve worked on sending official letters to relevant ministries, organizing activities in Dalieh, preparing legal and environmental research and producing slogans, visuals and videos to promote this space. We’ve also archived old photographs of the site, published press releases and filed lawsuits, among other interventions.
